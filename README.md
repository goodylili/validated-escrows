# terminal - Validated Escrows

NFT marketplaces and prediction markets already share a root: **escrow**. 

The simple premise is a trustless exchange under predefined conditions. The evolution is not just about merging them, but about creating a **fully on-chain validator and witness system** where consensus itself becomes programmable.

In this design, consensus isn’t proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. It’s **proof-of-witness**. A bet, an escrow, or a contract is settled when a quorum of predefined witnesses sign off, such as **x/x+y agreements, where 3 of 5 wallets** attest to the result.

The goal is to build this system side by side into chat and social apps where conversations happen, so users can place bets (deterministic or not) from conversations, which also bakes in virality as a marketing strategy for bets and the validated escrow.

Validated escrow exist on these primitives: 

- On-chain consensus mechanism.
- Trustless escrow on party rules.
- Everything is a bet; bet on anything.
- Your rules, your witnesses. Totally permissionless.

Remember when this happened? There were no rails both on social and onchain so they had to trust a third party

The validated escrow births two major action categories.

## Betting on Validated Escrows

Betting here isn’t just “who wins the game.” It’s a protocol for **any programmable agreement with stakes**.

- Users pool assets (fungible or NFTs).
- Terms are set and agreed after assets are locked.
- Bet creators can choose if contracts stay open for new entrants.
- Witnesses are assigned and publicly verified.
- Expiry is hardcoded; open-ended contracts possible.
- Resolution = either both betters agree (instant consensus) OR witness quorum validates.
- Witness counts are always odd to prevent deadlock.

Think of it as “Bet-as-a-primitive.” Every interaction can be structured as a bet—financial, social, or even reputational.

## Escrow on Terminal

Escrow is the other leg. Traditional escrow is siloed, private, often manual. Here, **escrow is public, on-chain, programmable, and mediated by witnesses**.

- Any asset can be escrowed against off-chain fulfillment.
- If both parties agree: instant release.
- Neither can exit unilaterally.
- Witnesses intervene only on dispute.
- Conflicts = fixed resolution windows (14 days, renewable).
- External arbitration can be layered in.

It’s not just transaction safety. It’s programmable **task assurance**. Payments, services, or even bounties can be escrowed, validated, and released under consensus.

## The Social Layer

The edge: social prediction. People already bet on **X, Telegram, Discord,** but informally, without rails. Terminal turns that activity into on-chain, **social consensus markets**. Communities can bootstrap their own validation layer, their own witness sets, and bet structures.

This unlocks:

- Permissionless social betting.
- Shared liquidity across platforms.

## The Big Picture

**Terminal = escrow + betting + social consensus.**

A fully on-chain market where assets, agreements, and validation converge.

Where everything is a bet, and every bet is a contract.

Where trust isn’t outsourced—it’s orchestrated by **your rules, your witnesses, your consensus.**
